# Excel-Playground-Starter
This is a simple Excel starter activity. 

In this activity, I am using Excel to average and assign a final grade for a class of 9 students.

## Analysis
Each student has a total of three grades. Those grades were averaged and bonus points were added to their final score. There were
six students that scored a 90 or above, with the other three students scoring an 80 or above. After adding bonus points, two students were able to raise
their grades from the 80s to the 90s. All but one student received bonus points. Final scores reflect a smart class.
